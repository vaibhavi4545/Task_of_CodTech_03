## Overview of the Project
**Project Overview: Neural Style Transfer**

**Key Components**
1) Content Image:
This is the base image whose structural and semantic details will be preserved in the final output.

2) Style Image:
This is the image that provides the artistic texture, patterns, and color palette to be applied to the content image.

3) Output Image:
The stylized image, which merges the content of the content image and the style of the style image.

**Tools and Technologies**
1) Programming Language: Python
2) Libraries: TensorFlow or PyTorch for model building, NumPy, Matplotlib for data handling and visualization.
3) Pre-trained Model: VGG-19 or similar CNNs for feature extraction.
4) Editor/IDE: VS Code or Jupyter Notebook for implementation.

**Learning Outcomes**
1) Deep understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their application in feature extraction.
2) Practical experience in Python-based deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3) Insights into optimization techniques and loss functions.
4) Knowledge of computer vision applications and artistic AI techniques.

**Result**
